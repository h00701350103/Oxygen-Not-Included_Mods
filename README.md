# jakkdl's Oxygen Not Included mods

## Emptera Fork/Void [WIP]
This is a fork of Pholith's very good Emptera mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1825146346 and inspired by the Minecraft mod Skyblock and Factorio's Seablock.

A custom config for the mod Care Package Manager is supplied, and is *required* in order to gain access to further resources and establish a sustainable base. Link: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1833878154  
Copy the config file and place it in your mods/ folder.

You should also use the No Leaky Walls mod by Cairath, this is required for airflow and mesh tiles in the vacuum of space, but also makes it easier to waste less resources when rebuilding. Link: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1766302971  
The Synchronized Telepad mod is also very nice: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1845654469

WARNING: This is a *hard* map. you will need to keep track of resource usage of pretty much everything and figure out how to best utilize your tools at hand. If you need tips&tricks read the rest of this readme and SPOILERS.md

Gameplay idea is that you start out in a minimal, barren, biome, with the bare necessities in terms of resources: raw minerals (mostly sandstone), iron ore, algae, coal and water. To gain access to seeds, critter eggs and other resources (e.g. slime, bleach stone, lead...) the available care packages from the printer are completely overhauled. Late game packages are gated by cycle count so you're guaranteed to get useful ones early game (e.g. mealwood seeds) and some early packages are unavailable late (e.g. mealwood seeds). There's several guaranteed geysers to supply resources impossible to get elsewhere.
There's also meteors raining down on you from the start, which is both a threat to manage but also gives access to valuable resources!

Differences from Pholith's Emptera:
* Starting biome completely rewritten. No access to any seeds or critters. The biome is smaller, but with careful biome tweaking and mass overrides there should be enough resources until you can get them from new sources.
* POIs/bunkers with minerals, seeds and critters removed.
* Space layer and Gravitas monument removed.
* Several different useful geysers guaranteed.
* All templates completely rewritten with different resources.
* Oil wells now in same type of template as geysers.
* Starting base template modified.
* New graphics gracefully provided by [TODO].
* Care Package Manager config written from scratch, total of X different packages.
* Many other minor modifications and other cleanup.

Big thanks to Pholith for inspiration, early guidance, and modding help.

See the SPOILERS.md file for implementation details as well as tips & tricks if you're struggling with the map, but I recommend going in blind and figuring out everything as you go along (and fail repeatedly) for the best experience!
