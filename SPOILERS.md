This file contains tips, tricks and details about the Void map. I *strongly* recommend playing the map at least once before reading this so you can have the experience of figuring out new problems without any handholding.


Map details:
* Globally you're guaranteed 8 generic geysers, and one each of the following geysers:
  * Chlorine gas - also available through printed bleach stone offgassing and rockets.
  * Natural gas - for power generation.
  * Salt Water - Only source (other than rockets) of salt and a good water source.
  * Polluted Water - to make farming arbor trees and spice vine long-term viable without abusing pips, and a good source of polluted dirt for farming Pokeshells to get lime-\>steel.
  * One of iron/gold/copper - good endless metal source.
* Any feature spawned in the bottom layer is unfortunately not too unlikely to spawn too far into the neutronium border and the object then disappears. That's why we guarantee at least two of each.  
  In the bottom layer you're guaranteed:
  * 2 Volcanoes - for a renewable source of igneous rock as building material.
  * 4 Oil wells - for oil obviously.
  * 2 neural vacillators - fun, and gotta have a use for acquired recharges.


Map tips:
* print mealwood seeds as soon as they're offered, and then blossom seeds. Research basic farming asap and dedicate one duplicant towards farming (banning the chore for everybody else) so they level up the farming skill and give you higher seed chance. Don't print more duplicants until you have secured food sources for them.
* Until you have better uses for them, you can vent carbon dioxide and polluted water straight into space.
* Do not research non-stop, this is a classic error when playing on hard difficulties. Only research what you need, when youneed it, and there's no emergencies needing duplicate attention. Bristle Blossoms can be handwatered and there's no hurry to replace outhouses.
* Research insulated tiles and build a line (ultimately across the whole map) to stop meteors. Expand gradually and repair them until a dust meteor has spawned regolith on them after which they're safe.
* Print hatch eggs and set up a farm to secure coal for a coal generator. Stop farming hatches as soon as you've secured better power sources (natgas) to not waste minerals.
* Research drywall early, but no need to rush. You can fit a lot in the starting biome if you're smart.
* Print reed fiber seeds when offered and pipe pwater from toilets into them to get cloth for atmo suits.
* Transition into electrolyzer relatively early to not run out of algae. Save the hydrogen to...
* ranch glossy dreckos ASAP for a good source of plastic, because you want to...
* build steam engines to start managing heat from buildings, and to tame volcanoes and cool down resources from geysers.
* Don't build drywall or create atmospheres if not necessary, many critters can be ranched in vacuum, and with a single tile of temp-shift plate+puddle of liquid+cooling loop heat-creating buildings can be run in space as well.
* If you don't find it an unfun mechanic (as I do), save as much natural tiles as possible in the starting biome, create new ones through tricky melting or shove voles, or through the Natural Tiles mod, and abuse pips planting of seeds to wildfarm plants for free resources. This is not required to make the map sustainable though.
* If you're having trouble with the encroaching cold of the granite and igneous rock tiles around the starting biome, build your farm in the middle of the biome. Digging out tiles also only drops half the mass, which means that the thermal energy in the disappearing half vanishes. So by digging out all colder tiles and leaving warmer sandstone tiles you can tweak where the equilibrium temperature of the system will finish. (This can also be used the other way around to postpone need for cooling the base longer. Dig out as few tiles as possible, and especially wait with cold tiles if possible until they're heated.) You can also use the heat from meteors, but that might be a bit tricky to manage.
